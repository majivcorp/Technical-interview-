The Technical aspect required a function which validate a SIN, initally timed for 30mins, extra time was given.
The main branch has inital attempt
with the code-correction branch containing minor changes and fixes to  the code. Below was the intial draft  prior to starting.
Spent a sizeable amount of time drafting my process.
Possible changes to the code more modular.


To do
	1. N array reads the input
	2. Y array = 121 212 121
	3. Z array = n*y
	4. If index element is greater than 10 (add numbers)
	5. Add all number of the array
	6. Sin is valid if sum % 9 ==0;
